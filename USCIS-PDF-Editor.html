            <p id="blacktext">Pre-redo, many users relied on thumbnail previews to navigate to pages of interest within a file.  However, with hundreds of pages, those thumbnails will start to visually blend together more and more.  We added metadata to each thumbnail, including comment previews and tags to differentiate between thumbnails with annotations.  We added a viewswitcher for users to toggle between the thumbnail view and larger page view, rather than keep thumbnails in a collapsible panel like before.</p>

			<p class="pr-5" id="blacktext">The biggest improvment to UX is the addition of filters.  Filters apply to both pages and thumbnails and allow users to more quickly navigate to pages of interest.  In addition, users can reduce visual clutter and overwhelming information by filtering out unrelated documents.  Our team determined the list of applicable filters and tested the new workflow with users, who had overwhelmingly positive feedback on the improved navigation system.  The visual presentation of the metadata used in filters also had to be reconfigured for visual consistency.</p>

			<p class="pr-5" id="blacktext">Users span multiple career levels with very different priorities.  Some users scroll through each document page-by-page for cursory review, some flag pages of interest, and others go back and forth with their direct reports to reach conclusions about the documents.  Each group has distinct preferences and workflows, which presented interesting design challenges and required our team to prioritize flexible workflows.  While we added features like filters, we had to be mindful that some users will not utilize the features and will resent extra visual noise on their screens.  We made the filters and annotation panels collapsible so that users can utilize as much screen space as they want, and kept the thumbnail navigation separate from the scrolling pages of documents to allow users to navigate in whatever way they wish.</p>
			<p class="pr-5" id="blacktext">We made significant changes to the UX to ensure that the product redesign would be scalable.  These changes required collaboration between engineering, design, and stakeholders, as well as rigorous usability testing and accessibility checks.  The final product is modernized, more visually appealling, and provides robust navigation features to address dramatically different requirements.</p>

Speaking with real users to learn about their day-to-day frustrations, pain points, and motivations was enlightening.  I made impactful design decisions ranging from UI updates, to new feature specifications, to tagging taxonomy.  Working with a team of experienced designers, engineers, and leaders was humbling and empowering.  I presented work to the client in multiple contexts including brainstorming sessions, usability study recaps, and legal reviews and learned about advocating for design in consulting contexts.  I mastered Axure prototyping techniques to create a complicated interactive prototype for user testing and prepared documentation and tracking metrics for development handoff.</p>
