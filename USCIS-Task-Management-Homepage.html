Our proposal tackles the thorny issue of responsive enterprise tables (no small task!), while recognizing the familiarity of the well-established workflow and development limitations prevent a full redesign.

            <p id="blacktext">In our new design, icons for badges and warnings are all placed in one column.  This column is always visible in the table, reflecting the importance of these distinctions.  The user has only one place to look for special cases, rather than having to check several columns to find out important information about their cases.  The badges are all one color, and we removed icons from the folder column because the folder is inherently different from the rest of the badges.  The only exception to the no-extraneous-icons rule is for notifications -- we determined that the notification bell is important enough that it should be designated with the recognizable bell icon, which is used elsewhere in the system UI.</p>

            <p class="pr-5" id="blacktext">This project demonstrated the importance of mobile-friendly design from the get-go.  We struggled to add responsiveness to the existing system, rather than enjoying a mobile-first design with responsiveness baked in.  Even for something as complicated as this table, responsive design is possible.  Leading the team through challenging iterations was very rewarding for me, and we reached our proposal only after much problem solving.  We also had to keep flexibility at the top of our mind, as this homepage serves a wide range of users with all different workflows.  Finally, the technical scope of the project was challenging, and pushed me to find creative solutions.  We couldn't add load time to the plodding page, and could only enhance rather than redesign the page.</p>
			<p class="pr-5" id="blacktext">Though my time at USCIS ended in February 2023, this project is still underway.  Next, our proposal needs to undergo usability testing to ensure the structural changes to the table work well for users.  Then, development of the enhancements can begin.  Future states of the design might include a separate table design specific to supervisors -- their workflow differs greatly form most officers, and this current system is not geared towards their administrative and staffing duties.  While our proposal greatly improves responsiveness, more drastic changes would need to be implemented to make this a truly mobile-friendly design.</p>
